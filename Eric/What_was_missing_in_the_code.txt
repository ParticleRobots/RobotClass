The missing part in the code was the initialization of the tempReading values:

Explanation of the Fixes:
Array Name Consistency:

I changed readings[] to reading[] in the loop that copies the values into the temporary array (tempReadings[]). Now, the array names match, and there is no confusion.

Median Calculation:

After you gather all the readings in reading[], the code sorts the values in tempReadings[] to calculate the median value.
